# Web Terminal

This is a simple HTML/JavaScript code that creates a terminal-like website. You can modify or create commands using JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this web terminal, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. You will be presented with a terminal-like interface where you can enter commands.

### Commands

The following commands are currently available:

- `iam`: Pass your name as an argument to be greeted by the terminal.
- `founder`: Displays the founder of the website.
- `help`: Displays a list of available commands.
- `ls`: Shows the current directory content.
- `nmap`: Runs a network scan.
- `pwd`: Shows the current directory.
- `sudo`: Runs as a super user (not really).
- `whoami`: Shows the current user.

Note that some of these commands may not function as expected, as this is a simple demonstration of a web terminal.
